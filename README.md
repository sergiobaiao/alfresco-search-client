# alfresco-search-client
A native Wordpress plugin that integrates with Hyland's Alfresco Content System

Upload the plugin to your Wordpress CMS, activate it and change related settings. 
When activated, a new "Alfresco Settings" page appears on your Wordpress Admin Menu.
There you need to put your Alfresco server URL (ending in /alfresco), your login details
and the site you want to provide the integration.

Is recomended that you create a Consumer (read-only) user for this integration.

After configured, simple add the [alfresco_search] shortcode in a new Wordpress page and Voil√°


Help wanted. If you want/know you way on both Wordpress and Alfresco and want to contribute, 
please contact me.
